# Matplotlib-Module5-Challenge

## Background

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Instructions

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

Submit your final analysis.

## Prepare the Data

Run the provided package dependency and data imports, and then merge the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

Display the number of unique mice IDs in the data, and then check for any mouse ID with duplicate time points. Display the data associated with that mouse ID, and then create a new DataFrame where this data is removed. Use this cleaned DataFrame for the remaining steps.

Display the updated number of unique mice IDs.

Display the updated number of unique mice IDs.

## Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
Generate two bar charts. Both charts should be identical and show the total number of time points for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the study.

Create the first bar chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.

Create the second bar chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.

Generate two pie charts. Both charts should be identical and show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

Create the first pie chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.

Create the second pie chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.
